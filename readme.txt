This is a FREE Hong Kong transport plugin that you can embed on your website.

== Description ==

This is a FREE Hong Kong transport plugin that you can embed on your website. We have a database of all transport links for every address in Hong Kong. Any web developer or web master can easily generate transport links for any address in Hong Kong and embed on your website.

The data you are inputting in the form are being submitted to the OneDay server (www.oneday.com.hk) and the server will return the script that generates the transport links block.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hong-kong-transport-links` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Once the plugin has been installed and activated, it should show the button with OneDay logo to the tinyMCE classic editor box.
4. When that button has been clicked, it should show a form. This is the form that you need to fill up to generate the transport links block.
5. After filling it up, there's a short code that is going to be generated that is going to be use to display the transport links block in the front-end.
6. After saving it, you should already see the transport links block in the front-end.
